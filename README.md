# Linux Git Client

The motivation for this project was:
1. Needed an idea for Hack Day at work.
2. I was (incorrectly) under the impression that no fully free SourceTree alternatives existed (SmartGit - free for personal use now it seems, and Git Extensions)
3. NWjs seemed like an interesting foundation for (seemingly) 'native' apps - so I figured I'd give it a go.

Who knows, maybe if I work on it enough in my spare time it'll be something that people could use!

For now, it's just a personal pet project so I won't yet be taking requests or anything of the sort. 

Feel free to report bugs on master or release versions.
